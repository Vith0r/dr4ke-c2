## Installation
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vith0r/dr4ke-c2.git
cd dr4ke-c2

# Build from source
go build -o drake-c2.exe
```

## Configuration
Dr4ke C2 uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) that includes:
- Server settings (port, bind address, timeouts)
- Database configuration (BoltDB or in-memory)
- Batch processing options
- Advanced security settings

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": "8080",
    "host": "localhost",
    "staticFilesPath": "static",
    "clientLimit": 1000,
    "readTimeout": 60,
    "writeTimeout": 60,
    "idleTimeout": 300,
    "serverKey": "drake-c2"
  },
  "database": {
    "type": "bolt",
    "filePath": "server/database/data/clients.db",
    "cacheSize": 10000,
    "boltTimeout": 5,
    "noSync": false
  }
}
```

## Building and Starting the Server

```powershell
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Compile the server
go build -o drake-c2.exe

# Basic usage with default settings
.\drake-c2.exe
```

**Building Clients**
1. Access the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`
2. Navigate to the Builder section
3. Configure payload options
4. Generate EXE or DLL payloads
